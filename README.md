# ProjectFakeNews
Experimenting with the development of an artificial neural network to identify fake news, with translation features. Results were very promising at first, while testing with data from the dataset, but not so much after testing it new cases from outside of it. After paying close attention, it was clear that the dataset was biased and not representative of general news.
